Welcome to **NordTorrent**! A seamless solution for running qBittorrent securely behind a NordVPN layer, all set up with a minimal, user-friendly "one-click" configuration. NordTorrent harnesses the robust privacy features of NordVPN, funneling all qBittorrent traffic through a secure, encrypted VPN tunnel. This ensures that your torrenting activity remains private and your internet connection is secure from prying eyes. With NordTorrent, you get the best of both worlds: the vast capabilities of qBittorrent for managing your torrents, combined with the enhanced privacy and security offered by NordVPN. All of these are accessible through a convenient web management portal at `localhost:8089`.

## üì¶ What's Inside?

NordTorrent offers a pre-configured Docker setup that packages qBittorrent with NordVPN, creating a secure torrenting environment right out of the box. This setup ensures that **every bit** of qBittorrent's traffic is routed exclusively through NordVPN's secure servers. Here‚Äôs why that‚Äôs important:

- **Privacy Protection**: With all traffic encrypted and routed through NordVPN, your torrenting activity is hidden from ISPs and potential eavesdroppers. NordVPN's no-logs policy means your activity remains yours alone.

- **Security Enhancement**: Leveraging NordVPN's world-class encryption and secure server network, NordTorrent protects your device from exposure to malicious entities often lurking in peer-to-peer networks.

- **Access Without Borders**: NordVPN‚Äôs global server network allows you to connect to peers across the world, potentially improving download speeds and bypassing geo-restrictions.

- **Simplicity and Accessibility**: Despite the sophisticated backend technology, accessing and managing your torrents is as simple as opening your web browser and navigating to `localhost:8089`.

Experience an unparalleled level of privacy and security in your torrenting activities with NordTorrent, all while maintaining the ease and flexibility of qBittorrent's powerful features.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   First things first, we want to clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/queball1999/NordTorrent.git
    cd NordTorrent
    ```

2. **Get Your NordVPN Secret Key:**
   Next, you need to retrieve your NordVPN secret key. Replace `myemail@domain.com`, `mypassword`, and `mytoken` with your NordVPN credentials and token:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -e USER=myemail@domain.com -e PASS=mypassword -e TOKEN=mytoken bubuntux/nordvpn:get_private_key
   ```
   In order to obtain a toke, please visit [How to obtain NordVPN Token](https://support.nordvpn.com/Connectivity/Linux/1905092252/How-to-log-in-to-NordVPN-on-Linux-with-a-token.htm#:~:text=Go%20to%20nordaccount.com%20and,Click%20on%20Generate%20new%20token).
   
3. **Edit the docker-compose.yaml File:**
   Open the docker-compose.yaml and add your NordVPN secret key:

    ```bash
    nano docker-compose.yaml
    ```

4. **Launch NordTorrent:**
   With your secret key in place, start your secure torrenting environment:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
    Ensure you are running this command in the same directory as the docker-compose.yaml
  
6. **Access qBittorrent:**
   Open your web browser and go to localhost:8089 to start managing your torrents securely. The default credentials are ```admin \ adminadmin```

## üìñ Configuration
  ### Changing the Download Path in qBittorrent
  The download path for qBittorrent within the Docker container is determined by the volume mounts specified in your docker-compose.yaml file. By default, you might have something like this:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - "./downloads/QBitTorrent:/downloads"
  ```
  This line mounts the host directory ./downloads/QBitTorrent to the /downloads directory inside the container. To change the download location, you simply need to adjust the host path. 
  
  ### Here's a step-by-step guide:
  
  Identify the New Download Location: Determine where on your host machine you want qBittorrent to download files. For example, let's say you want to use /data/torrents/qbittorrent as the new location.

  ### Update the docker-compose.yaml File:
  Open your docker-compose.yaml file in a text editor:

  ```bash
  nano docker-compose.yaml
  ```
  Find the volumes section under the qBittorrent service and update the path before the colon (:) to your new desired download location, like so:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - "/data/torrents/qbittorrent:/downloads"
  ```
  Ensure that the path you specify exists on your host machine, or create it if necessary.

  ### Apply the Changes:
  After saving your changes to the docker-compose.yaml file, you'll need to recreate the qBittorrent container for the changes to take effect. Navigate to the directory containing your docker-compose.yaml file and run:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
  This command recreates the qBittorrent container with the new volume mount, effectively changing the download path to the new location you specified.
  
  ### Verify in qBittorrent:
    Once the container is up and running, access the qBittorrent web UI at localhost:8089, and navigate to the settings. Under the Downloads section, you should see that the default save path reflects the path inside the container (/downloads),     which is now mapped to your new host directory.
